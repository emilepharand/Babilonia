Babilonia is an innovative tool for language enthusiasts who want to **grow and strengthen** their **vocabulary** in foreign languages. It seeks to unlock the power of vocabulary to express your thoughts and understand languages. As your vocabulary improves, so do your language skills!

At its core, Babilonia leverages your **muscle memory** to help you learn **more words**, **faster**. Also, unlike traditional methods, Babilonia lets you practice multiple languages **at the same time**! üòç

## Main Features
- Enables you to memorize a **maximum** amount of words in a **minimum** amount of time ‚åõ
- Contains clever tricks to help you remember words **as you're typing** üß†
- Builds on top of **partial knowledge** of words üèóÔ∏è
- **Tracks** of how many words you know in each language üìà
- Uses a novel method based on **universal ideas** üí°
- Lets you practice any set of languages **all at once**! ü§Ø

## The Power of Targeted Help
Learning works best when it's **interactive**. Babilonia works with what you know and builds up from there. It gives you **instant feedback** as you're practicing and **helpful hints** when you need them. It's like your own personal teacher!

As you're typing, Babilonia will **highlight** your answer in **red** or **green** to let you know if you're on the right track.

Babilonia's approach is to help you remember **on your own**. Often, you will find that even if you can't remember a word, you can still remember **parts of it**. It may be its first letter, its ending, or how it sounds. If you **get a hint**, the memory may spring back to your mind. There's a good reason for the idiom "it's on the tip of my tongue"!

Rather than revealing **the entire word**, which would prevent you from remembering it by yourself, Babilonia gives you **the next letter**. Going from getting a hint, to typing what you know, to getting another hint is much more **interactive and fun**. Most importantly, this way of practicing makes you significantly **more likely to remember** more parts of the word the next time!

That is why we say that Babilonia rewards and builds upon **partial knowledge**. If you know *some* letters in a word, you can still get it partially correct. **Remembering more letters means progress**, even if you don't recall the entire word. That is very motivating, and it also lets you focus more on the letters that you actually didn't get right.

Of course, sometimes, you simply don't know. No need to go through hints then: you can get **the complete word**. After all, you have to start somewhere!

## A Polyglot's Paradise
Babilonia lets you practice **any number of languages at the same time**. Most language learning tools only allow you to practice one language at a time. But what if you want to master *multiple* languages? It would be incredibly convenient to practice them at the same time! Babilonia enables you to do just that.

That comes with many benefits. For one, you get to exercise the **mental gymnastics** of quickly **switching between languages**, which is an invaluable skill for a polyglot. Also, you learn to **associate between them** the words in different languages to convey the same idea, which helps you remember them more easily. Plus, it's an incredibly **efficient** way to practice when you want to learn multiple languages.

Of course, even though you *could* practice tons of languages at the same time, it doesn't mean you *have* to! You can always choose which languages you would like to study. It could be one, two or any combination of languages. Flexibility is key.

## Personalize Your Learning
**Mark expressions as "known"** as you encounter them. Doing so allows you to get **personalized learning**, as you can tell Babilonia to make you **practice only words that you have not yet mastered**. That means you can focus on practicing what you actually need to learn and not repeat words you have already acquired.

## Track Your Progress
Being able to track your progress is a key element for **staying motivated**. Another benefit of marking expressions as "known" is that Babilonia can **track your progress** and show you **statistics** on how many words you have learned.

Seeing those numbers go up is, on its own, a worthwhile goal to pursue. It is also an **excellent measure** of your progress in any language and helps you compare which languages you know better than others and **where to direct your efforts**.

## Use **expressions** to express your **ideas**
Two important concepts that Babilonia uses are `ideas` and `expressions`. They are very simple yet powerful notions.

### Ideas are universal

In a nutshell, the concept of ideas is that words in one language are **grouped** with words in other languages **that express the same idea**. While dictionaries organize vocabulary **by words**, Babilonia organizes vocabulary **by ideas**. There are as many ideas as there are **meanings** for a word.

That's because, in Babilonia, **no language is the single point of reference**. Every language has its quirks, similarities and differences. Thus, practicing multiple languages at the same time requires a **universal system**.

For example, in English, you `play` music like you `play` a sport. It's a homonym: all languages have them. Spanish conveys those two meanings with two distinct words: `tocar` and `jugar`. While an English-Spanish dictionary would list those two words under `to play`, Babilonia views them as **two separate ideas**. Learners practice them separately as they *are* two distinct entities.

### Expressions are more than words
Often, an expression is simply a **word**, like `beer`, `cold`, `very`, or `to drink`.

But it could also be **a phrase, an expression, an idiom, a saying, or any other useful sentence**. That's why `word` could not be used to represent this concept. For example, these are all expressions:
- `how are you?`
- `what's your name?`
- `watch out!`
- `the cost of living`
- `it's raining cats and dogs`

Expressions are the **fundamental elements** that you practice in Babilonia.

## Never change your keyboard layout again
When **simultaneously** practicing languages that use **different alphabets**, you may find it impractical to type in **the right letter with the correct accent** in every word of every language. Not only does that require you to change your keyboard settings a lot, but also to learn what combination of keys on your keyboard allows you to type each accented letter.

That can add a lot of friction to your learning. Mastering spelling *is* important, but if your goal is to **practice as many words as possible**, getting each accent right may not be your priority. Furthermore, many people find it valuable to learn a new language **without the added difficulty of accents**.

To help with that, you can **disable "strict mode"**. With this setting enabled, Babilonia will accept the **unaccented form** of a letter instead of any accented form. For example, `e` will automatically be transformed into `√®`.

Currently, this feature only supports languages using the Latin alphabet. Future releases will include ways to never have to change your keyboard layout for *any* alphabet. Stay tuned!

## Use included vocabulary and add your own
As of version 2.0, the application comes with a set of **[insert number here] expressions** and **[insert number here] ideas** in **5 languages**: English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. **More get added with each release**.

You can also easily **add your own** expressions, ideas and languages.

Keep in mind that ideas and expressions that Babilonia includes can change at any time in a future update. However, the ideas you add will never be modified.

The application stores its data in the `db.db` file at the project's root in `SQLite` format.

## A caveat to finish
**Vocabulary is only one part** of language learning. That's why Babilonia does not seek to be the be-all and end-all of language learning tools. *Nothing is*. Learning languages require a **variety of sources**. *However*, we believe that acquiring vocabulary is the most important aspect of learning languages, which unlocks a world of possibilities. Babilonia aims to fulfill that goal efficiently.

## How to run

All you need is `node` (tested with `16.16.0`) and `Chromium` or `Firefox`. Grab the most recent release, `cd` into your download folder and execute `node index.cjs`.
