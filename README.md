# Babilonia

Babilonia is an innovative tool for language enthusiasts and new learners who want to grow and strengthen their vocabulary in foreign languages. Whether you want to learn a few words in another language or fully master your favorite foreign language, Babilonia is your friend.

Babilonia leverages your muscle memory to help you learn more, faster. Also, unlike traditionnal methods, Babilonia lets you practice multiple languages *at the same time*! :heart_eyes:

## Main features

- Lets you memorize a *maximum* amount of words in a *minimum* amount of time
- Contains clever tricks to help you remember as you're typing
- Builds on top of partial knowledge of words
- Keeps track of how many words you know in each language
- Uses a novel method based on universal ideas
- Allows you to practice any set of languages all at once!

## Some use cases
- You want to learn a few words in a language? (The casual)
- You want to know virtually all words in Spanish? (The fanatic)
- You want to be able to express 1000 ideas in 5 languages? (The achiever)
- You want to know how to express some minimum number of expressions in a large number of languages? (The megapolyglot)
- You want to know every word in the universe? (The utopist)
- All of the above? (The language enthusiast)

## How does it work?

### Powerful help as you're practicing

The core component of Babilonia is its practice feature.

An idea shows up (in any language you want), and you get to practice it (in any other language you want). Many things can happen:

- You know the expression. You type, it's green, you smile and you go to the next one.
- You know the expression. You also think you known how it is spelled. As you type, your receive instant feedback. On the first misspelled letter, Babilonia tells you that you are not on the right track. It sparks an insight: you just remembered the correct spelling. Awesome!
- The expression is right on the tip of your tongue. Would giving it out in full to you help? Maybe. But what about just a hint of the first two letters? Eureka! Now you remembered it by yourself, you (or your brain) will more easily remember them the next time.
- You simply don't know the expression at all. That's okay! In that case, you can hit the `Show` button (or reveal it letter by letter) and the next time, you just might remember a part of it.

All of this exemplifies the fact that partial knowledge of an expression is rewarded and built upon. If you know some letters in an expression, you can get it partially correct. That partial knowledge increases with time and eventually, full knowledge is achieved.

### Ideas and expressions: how they're used
Ideas and expressions mean something special in Babilonia.

Let's begin with expressions. Often, an expression is a word, like `hot` or `to go`. However, it could also be a locution or a whole sentence. That's why `word` cannot be used. Also, `word` is not a well-defined concept, and certainly no definition would include the phrase `How are you?`, which absolutely has its place in Babilonia. `Expressions` was chosen to represent this notion.

An idea in Babilonia is a single concept that can be expressed in at least one language. For example, he idea of `hot` exists in our minds, and expressions allow us to express it. Some languages use the same word to express two ideas in another one, and vice-versa, and that is the power of ideas. For example, the French do not say `siblings` but `frères et soeurs` (brothers and sisters). So we need three ideas (`brother`, `sister`, `sibling`), not two.

### Context where necessary
Sometimes, the same word can have multiple meanings. For example, in French, `avocat` can mean attorney or avocado, depending on context. So if you see that word, you might wonder which idea it is. Contexts are just for that.

A context is additional information in an expression that only serves to identify which idea it represents. It is put inside parentheses and is not practiced. For example, `avocat (fruit)` makes it clear that attorney is not the right answer.

### Flexible ways to practice
Even though you *could* practice tons of languages at the same time, it doesn't mean you always *have* to! Maybe you'd like to focus on some, or one, language.

You can choose which languages you would like to study in Languages -> Set Practice Languages.

Words whose languages are set to "practice" will be hidden when practicing,
and others will show. Also, ideas which do not have any words with languages set to "practice" will not show up when practicing.

A very important feature of Babilonia is its flexibility when it comes to practicing different sets of languages.

### Numbers as a motivator
Your dashboard shows how many expressions you know in each language, as well as how many ideas you are able to express in each of them. It is very satisfying and motivating to see those numbers go up. You can mark expressions as known as you encounter them. What qualifies as "known" is entirely up to you, as you are the best judge of whether you truly know an expression. A good indication could be if you can type it out in full without any help, a week or a month after learning it.

Also, known expressions can be set to not appear when practicing. That way, you can focus on practicing only the words that you don't know!

### Accents and keyboard layouts, simplified
If you practice multiple languages at the same time that have different written alphabets, you may not want to constantly be changing your keyboard settings. Or maybe you think you can learn faster if you forget about accents first.

That's why you can disable "strict mode" and, for instance, `e` will be accepted for `é`.

### The data
You can either start empty and add your own ideas, or you can import predefined ideas. Predefined ideas are a list that grows with each release. If you choose to import predefined ideas, be aware that those ideas could change in a future update. Your custom-added ideas will not be touched.
